abstract = {A blockchain is essentially a distributed database of records, or public ledger of all transactions or digital events that have been executed and shared among participating parties. Each transaction in the public ledger is verified by consensus of a majority of the participants in the system. Once entered, information can never be erased. The blockchain contains a certain and verifiable record of every single transaction ever made. Bitcoin, the decentralized peer-to-peer digital currency, is the most popular example that uses blockchain technology. The digital currency bitcoin itself is highly controversial but the underlying blockchain technology has worked flawlessly and found wide range of applications in both financial and non-financial world. The main hypothesis is that the blockchain establishes a system of creating a distributed consensus in the digital online world. This allows participating entities to know for certain that a digital event happened by creating an irrefutable record in a public ledger. It opens the door for developing a democratic open and scalable digital economy from a centralized one. There are tremendous opportunities in this disruptive technology, and the revolution in this space has just begun. This white paper describes blockchain technology and some compelling specific applications in both financial and non-financial sector. We then look at the challenges ahead and business opportunities in this fundamental technology that is all set to revolutionize our digital world.},

abstract = {Recently there has been quite a number of independent research activities that investigated the potentialities of integrating social networking concepts into Internet of Things (IoT) solutions. The resulting paradigm, named Social Internet of Things (SIoT), has the potential to support novel applications and networking services for the IoT in more effective and efficient ways. In this context, the main contributions of this paper are the following: (i) we identify appropriate policies for the establishment and the management of social relationships between objects in such a way that the resulting social network is navigable; (ii) we describe a possible architecture for the IoT that includes the functionalities required to integrate things into a social network; (iii) we analyze the characteristics of the SIoT network structure by means of simulations.},

@article{Fernandez-Carames2018,
abstract = {The paradigm of Internet of Things (IoT) is paving the way for a world where many of our daily objects will be interconnected and will interact with their environment in order to collect information and automate certain tasks. Such a vision requires, among other things, seamless authentication, data privacy, security, robustness against attacks, easy deployment and self-maintenance. Such features can be brought by blockchain, a technology born with a cryptocurrency called Bitcoin. In this paper it is presented a thorough review on how to adapt blockchain to the specific needs of IoT in order to develop Blockchain-based IoT (BIoT) applications. After describing the basics of blockchain, the most relevant BIoT applications are described with the objective of emphasizing how blockchain can impact traditional cloud-centered IoT applications. Then, the current challenges and possible optimizations are detailed regarding many aspects that affect the design, development and deployment of a BIoT application. Finally, some recommendations are enumerated with the aim of guiding future BIoT researchers and developers on some of the issues that will have to be tackled before deploying the next generation of BIoT applications.},

@article{Nakamoto2008,
abstract = {Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

abstract={The Internet has achieved unprecedented success in human history. However, its original design has encountered many challenges in the past decades due to the significant changes of context and requirements. As a result, the design of future networks has received great attention from both academia and industry, and numerous novel architectures have sprung up in recent years. Among them, the locator/identifier (Loc/ID) split networking is widely discussed for its decoupling of the overloaded IP address semantics, which satisfies several urgent needs of the current Internet such as mobility, multihoming, routing scalability, security, and heterogeneous network convergence. Hence, in this paper, we focus on Loc/ID split network architectures, and provide a related comprehensive survey on their principles, mechanisms, and characteristics. First, we illustrate the major serious problems of the Internet caused by the overloading of IP address semantics. Second, we classify the existing Loc/ID split network architectures based on their properties, abstract the general principle and framework for each classification, and demonstrate related representative architectures in detail. Finally, we summarize the fundamental features of the Loc/ID split networking, compare corresponding investigated architectures, and discuss several open issues and opportunities.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) applications will be based on the interactions between smart objects. In many applications such interactions are possible (or meaningful) when objects are close to each others, i.e., there is a co-presence. Unfortunately, to date there are no data traces providing information about the copresence of smart objects. Indeed, several mobility traces reporting humans' movements are available, but none of them contains information about the interactions between their objects. Objective of the work reported in this paper is to fill this gap. To this purpose, we start from user mobility patterns available from several datasets. We associate to each user a set of objects, based on a survey we have carried out over around 450 users. Accordingly, we analyze the statistics about the co-presence of objects. We carry out our analysis by exploiting the tools developed for the analysis of complex networks. Our objective is to identify the objects which are likely to play a key role in the interactions between smart objects in the IoT.},
